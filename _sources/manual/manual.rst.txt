User Guide
==========

Tizonia provides an efficient and unbstrusive music search and listening
experience by following a few principles:

**Simplest CLI UI**
  Because the keyboard is faster than the mouse you get to listen to the music
  that you want in less time. Music plays almost immediately.

**Play the music, not matter what**
  Tizonia uses fuzzy string matching techniques to match your search keywords
  against the data provided by the streaming services. This maximizes the
  chances of finding the music that you want. When a search returns no
  results Tizonia may at times try a 'I'm Feeling Lucky' guess.

**Non-stop music**
  Tizonia's play queue always runs in **looped** mode. There is currently no
  way to configure non-looped playback (although this may be added in the
  future, see [#f1]_).

**Limit the distractions**
  By limiting the interactions. No fast-forward or rewind. Only skip to
  next/previous track (see [#f2]_). There is no elaborate 'ncurses' CLI
  interface to interact with. But there is some track info and a simple visual
  progress bar.

**Reduced 'muscle-memory'**
  Finding the music that you want and listening to it should require a single
  command-line option on the terminal. E.g.: ``tizonia --spotify-album Islands``.
  Bash and Zsh completions are available. There is also a
  `Oh-my-zsh <https://ohmyz.sh/>`_ plugin available `here
  <https://github.com/tizonia/tizonia-openmax-il/blob/master/player/tools/tizonia.plugin.zsh>_.
