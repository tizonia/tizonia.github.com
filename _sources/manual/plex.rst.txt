Plex
====

Tizonia can stream audio from a Plex server. To stream from a Plex server, it
is necessary to provide the base URL where the server can be contacted and the
authentication token. These two elements must be provided on the command-line
or via configuration file.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The Tizonia configuration file contains a block under the ``[tizonia]`` section
like the one pictured below (see also :ref:`tizonia-config-label`).

.. warning:: When credentials are stored in your local
             ``tizonia.conf``, please ensure that this file has the correct
             file system permissions to prevent other users from accessing your
             credentials.

             E.g.: ``$ chmod og-rwx $HOME/.config/tizonia/tizonia.conf``

.. code-block:: bash

   # Plex configuration
   # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   # To avoid passing this information on the command line, uncomment and
   # configure your Plex server and account auth token here.
   #
   # To find how to obtain a Plex user authentication token, see:
   # https://support.plex.tv/articles/204059436-finding-an-authentication-token-x-plex-token/
   #
   # plex.base_url = xxxxxxxxxxxxxx (e.g. http://plexserver:32400)
   # plex.auth_token = xxxxxxxxxxxxxx (e.g. SrPEojhap3H5Qj2DmjhX)
   # plex.buffer_seconds = size of the audio buffer (in seconds) to use
   #                       while downloading streams. Default: 600.
   #                       Increase in case of cuts.
   # plex.music_section_name = name of the music section in your plex library
   #                           (default: Music)

``plex.base_url``
  The base URL of the Plex server, e.g. http://plexserver:32400.

``plex.auth_token``
  The user authentication token to be used during communication with the Plex server. To find the token:

  - Sign in to your Plex account in the Plex Web App.

  - Browse to a library item and click on the Get Info menu item.

  - From the Media Info screen, click on View XML.

  - Look in the URL and find the token as the X-Plex-Token value

``plex.buffer_seconds``
  This is the minimum size of the audio buffer (in seconds) that Tizonia will
  use while downloading the audio streams. It may be increased in case of
  cuts, but usually not required. Default: 60.

``plex.music_section_name``
  The name of the 'music' section in the Plex library that will be used by
  Tizonia for searching and streaming. Defaults: Music. Useful for users that
  have renamed their music library to something different from the default or
  users that have more than one music library.
