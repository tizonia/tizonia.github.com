Spotify
=======

A Spotify Premium account is required to stream audio from Spotify. Tizonia
will not work with a Spotify Free account. Please introduce your Premium
account's user name and password into ``tizonia.conf``, or alternatively, use
the corresponding command-line options available.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The Tizonia configuration file contains a block under the ``[tizonia]`` section
like the one pictured below (see also :ref:`tizonia-config-label`).

.. warning:: When user names and passwords are stored in your local
             ``tizonia.conf``, please ensure that this file has the correct
             file system permissions to prevent other users from accessing your
             credentials.

             E.g.: ``$ chmod og-rwx $HOME/.config/tizonia/tizonia.conf``


.. code-block:: bash

   # Spotify configuration
   # -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   # To avoid passing this information on the command line, uncomment
   # and configure accordingly
   #
   # spotify.user     = user
   # spotify.password = pass
   # spotify.recover_lost_token = false (set to true to continue playback after
   #                                     the token has been [spuriously?] lost)
   # spotify.allow_explicit_tracks = false (set to true to allow explicit tracks)
   # spotify.preferred_bitrate = Three possible values: 96, 160, or 320 ; default: 320

``spotify.user``
   The username of the Spotify Premium account. For older accounts, the
   username may be related to account email address (i.e. same as the email
   address without the @domain). For newer accounts, the username is a random
   string of around 25 characters allocated by Spotify.

.. note:: If you created your account through Facebook you will need to create
          a "device password" to stream from Spotify using Tizonia. Note that
          the device password option is only available for Facebook-created
          accounts. Please read the Spotify documentation at
          http://www.spotify.com/account/set-device-password/.

``spotify.password``
   Password of the Premium account. Please do not allow '#' in
   the password. There is a bug in Tizonia that prevents this character in the
   password field.

``spotify.recover_lost_token``
  Set to ``true`` to allow Tizonia to resume playback and recover the token
  automatically when the playback token is lost. This can occur if for example,
  another device starts streaming using your account (e.g. listening to Spotify
  on an Echo device while Tizonia is already streaming on your
  computer). Optional (Default: false).

``spotify.allow_explicit_tracks``
  Set to ``true`` to allow explicit tracks in Tizonia's play queue. Otherwise,
  explicit tracks are removed from the queue before playback. Optional
  (Default: false).

``spotify.preferred_bitrate``
  Select the preferred bitrate while streaming from Spotify. Three possible
  values: 96, 160, or 320. Optional (Default: 320).
