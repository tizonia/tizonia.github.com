Google Play Music
=================

Music streaming from the Google Play Music service is supported on both free
and paid tiers. In both cases, credentials are required to be input via
command-line or configuration file.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The Tizonia configuration file contains a block under the ``[tizonia]`` section
like the one pictured below (see also :ref:`tizonia-config-label`).

.. warning:: When user names and passwords are stored in your local
             ``tizonia.conf``, please ensure that this file has the correct
             file system permissions to prevent other users from accessing your
             credentials.

             E.g.: ``$ chmod og-rwx $HOME/.config/tizonia/tizonia.conf``


.. code-block:: bash

   #                          2-factor users)
   # gmusic.device_id  = deviceid (16 hex digits, e.g. '1234567890abcdef')
   # gmusic.buffer_seconds = size of the audio buffer (in seconds) to use while
   #                         downloading streams. Default: 720. Increase in
   #                         case of cuts.
